## Things to improve
A lot of ideas were left out in the interest of time. But without time as a constraint, the following were improvements that were in the initial conceptualisation of the project.  

1. Create a stats view that allows users to see how their applications fare with cold applying and networking.
2. Create a progress view to visualize progress through different stages of the application.
3. Create python scripts to scrape the web for relevant job postings.
4. There are some obvious issues with useEffect but these were ignored as the project was unlikely to become a viable product in the real world.
